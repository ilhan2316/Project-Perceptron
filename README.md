# Perceptron Classifier for Iris Dataset

This project implements a simple perceptron classifier to classify the Iris dataset.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of various iris flowers. The goal is to classify the iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal length and width.

## How it Works

The perceptron classifier is a type of linear classifier that learns to separate data points belonging to different classes by finding an optimal decision boundary. It iteratively updates its weights and bias based on the misclassification of training examples until convergence.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `perceptron_iris.py` script.
4. The script will train the perceptron model on the Iris dataset and evaluate its accuracy.
5. Experiment with different hyperparameters and feature engineering techniques to improve the accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
